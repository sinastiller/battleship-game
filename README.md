# BATTLESHIP GAME

The Battleship Game is a small computer vs. user game,is designed by using Python and running in the Heroku App. It is based on the famous Battleship Game Board version.

The Battleship Game is a war-themed game for people of all ages. It has been around for many years and also known by a big amount of our populations. It is usually played between two players, the computer and the user in this case. Each of them will have five ships, which the computer will place randomly on its grid. The user will choose where to place their ships on their game board. During the game both opponents are trying to hit and destroy each others ships without knowing their location. The first one to acchieve this goal wins the game and is therefore the reigning hero of the battlefield.

### [Typography](#typography)

The game in the Heroku App is mostly running with its standard font. I have imported a special font for the first line of the welcoming message from [Lingojam](https://lingojam.com/CoolTextFonts) and copied special codes to acchieve a bold font or coloured font from a [Stackoverflow Post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8924173/how-can-i-print-bold-text-in-python).

### [Wireframes](#wireframes)

I have used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to create the wrieframe and flowchart of the Battleship Game. The main part of the game is made out of two grids, one for the player and the other one for the computer, each containing the ships.

The flowchart is made to guide me throught the process to acknowlegde each step during the game, designing the various functions needed for the game flow.

This is my initial approach towards my project, which might change throughout the process of the game development.
